# fexproto

Not yet finished implementation of John Shutt's [Kernel language](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~jshutt/kernel.html) in Python 3.7+.

Another implementation using the [RPython toolchain](https://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is also being worked on and is source compatible with both Python 2.7 and 3.7+.

Note that `$vau` and `eval` have slightly different parameters.
